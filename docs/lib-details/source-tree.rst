Source Tree Structure
----------------------

The source folder structure is organized according to the described architecture in the library architecture section.


Additional folders for utilities and metadata files (i.e. makefiles, manifests, git files, LICENSE, ...) 
used by the software toolchain and development environment can (and will) as well be found in these folders together with the .hpp, .h, .cpp and .c sources.
